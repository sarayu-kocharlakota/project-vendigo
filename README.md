## Power Supply Notes

- The RFID-RC522 is powered by the 3.3V pin of the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
- The continuous rotation servo motor requires an external power supply. Connect the servo's positive (red) wire to the positive terminal of the external power supply, and the ground (brown) wire to the ground terminal.

## Additional Notes

- The RFID-RC522 module uses SPI communication, which requires configuring the correct pins for SPI0 on the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
- The 16x2 LCD uses the I2C protocol and is connected via the SDA and SCL lines.
- The 4x4 Matrix Keypad is connected to a set of GPIO pins (GP8â€“GP15) for scanning the row and column inputs.
- Ensure that the servos are properly powered with a separate power supply if needed, as the Raspberry Pi Pico W might not supply enough current to drive multiple motors.
